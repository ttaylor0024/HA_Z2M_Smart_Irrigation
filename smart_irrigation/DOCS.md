## üñ•Ô∏è Using the Web Interface

### Dashboard Overview

The main dashboard shows:
- **Active Zones**: Number of enabled zones
- **Water Saved**: Amount of water conserved today
- **Next Run**: When the next irrigation will start
- **Weather Status**: Current weather decision (Normal/Skip/Reduce)

### Zone Management

Each zone card displays:
- Current status (idle, running, completed)
- Schedule and duration settings
- Last run time and water usage
- Live sensor readings (if configured)

**Zone Controls**:
- **Run**: Manually start irrigation
- **Settings**: Adjust schedule and parameters
- **Toggle**: Enable/disable the zone

### Quick Actions

Floating action buttons provide:
- **Run All**: Start all enabled zones
- **Test Mode**: Run each zone for 1 minute to test

### Weather Information

The weather section shows:
- Forecast rain amount
- Probability of precipitation
- Recent rainfall
- Current irrigation decision

## üîß Advanced Features

### Sensor Integration

**Flow Sensors**:
- Monitor real-time water flow
- Track total water usage per zone
- Detect potential leaks or blockages

**Moisture Sensors**:
- Skip watering when soil is already moist
- Set custom thresholds per zone
- Optimize water usage

### Zone Types

Different zone types have optimized defaults:
- **Lawn**: Standard grass areas
- **Garden**: Vegetable gardens
- **Drip**: Drip irrigation systems
- **Flowers**: Flower beds
- **Trees**: Tree watering zones

### Water Conservation

The system automatically:
- Skips watering when rain is forecast
- Reduces duration based on recent rainfall
- Tracks water saved from smart decisions
- Monitors total usage per zone

## üìä API Endpoints

For advanced users and integrations:

- `GET /api/status` - Get full system status
- `POST /api/run_zone` - Start a specific zone
- `POST /api/run_all` - Start all zones
- `GET /api/weather_check` - Get weather conditions
- `POST /api/toggle_zone` - Enable/disable a zone
- `POST /api/update_zone` - Update zone settings

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Add-on Won't Start
1. Check the add-on logs for errors
2. Verify your weather API key is valid
3. Ensure at least one zone is configured
4. Check that entity IDs are correct

### Zones Not Running
1. Verify the zone is enabled
2. Check that the entity exists in Home Assistant
3. Ensure schedule time hasn't passed today
4. Review weather conditions (might be skipping)

### Weather Data Missing
1. Verify API key is correct
2. Check your API usage limits
3. Ensure latitude/longitude are correct
4. Try a different weather provider

### Sensor Issues
1. Verify sensor entity IDs are correct
2. Check sensors are reporting values
3. Ensure threshold values are reasonable
4. Check Home Assistant logs

## üí° Tips & Best Practices

1. **Schedule Early**: Water in early morning (4-8 AM) to minimize evaporation
2. **Zone Types Matter**: Use appropriate durations for different plant types
3. **Start Conservative**: Begin with shorter durations and adjust based on results
4. **Monitor Sensors**: Regularly check sensor readings for accuracy
5. **Seasonal Adjustments**: Update schedules seasonally as weather changes
6. **Test Regularly**: Use test mode monthly to ensure all valves work
7. **Track Usage**: Monitor water consumption trends in the dashboard

## üîê Security & Privacy

- All data stays local to your Home Assistant instance
- Weather API calls are made directly from the add-on
- No data is sent to third parties
- API keys are stored securely in your configuration
